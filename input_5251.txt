# The "@ something" is a commentary for ploting and is optional .
# Errors are optional in the input file, but the program does not suppot 
# errors only in part of the parameters; if you wish to use an output from 
# the program for another fit including a new component, be aware that you 
# should include errors (although errors are not used for the fitting.
# Errors for a given model have to be computed after a model is choosen using
# bootstrapping. 
# The second number besides a component indicates whether the parameters is 
# free for varying (0) or fixed (1). In the example all parameters are free.

# Other examples of functions already deployed:
# I encourage people to free parameters progressively while fitting a 
#@ brokenexp function because it is unstable (specially the alpha parameter)
# In a first fit, let alpha=1 fixed and calculated it latter after the model is 
# alread very close to the final solution.
